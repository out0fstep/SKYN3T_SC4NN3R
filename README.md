## 📡 Overview
**Skyn3t Sc4nn3r** is an experimental Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning tool built for ESP32-S3 devices (LilyGO T-Deck and similar).  
It pairs a distinctive cyber-punk UI with practical scanning features and a headless mode that serves a command page over a private AP (useful if the device display is cracked).
